<h3>Strength And Weaknesses:</h3>
<p>Quick learner, Hardworking and outgoing (making friends easily) i think these are my greatest strength
which will definately help me working effeciently in organisation and help in achieving its goals.
Due to overthinking and overanalyzing sometimes i get caught in process and it may take time to
complete the task , but this also makes me a cautious person and helps to analyse situation in better way
which i think would help in positive manner to organisation.</p>
